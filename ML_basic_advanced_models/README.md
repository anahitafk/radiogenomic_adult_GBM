### Requirements
- MATLAB 2018b or above
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

### Description
These models are generated for the following genes or pathways:
- EGFR gene
- PTEN gene
- NF1 gene
- TP53 gene
- RTK pathway
- PI3K pathway
- MAPK pathway
- P53 pathway

The code "Predict_GBM_Mutation.m" should be used for prediction of the presence or absence of mutations in any of the genes or pathways mentioned above.

The "dnafinder-roc-b84f535" directory should be added to the MATLAB path for prediction of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
